# glide.nix

A binary package for [Glide Browser](https://glide-browser.app) until Glide is in nixpkgs ([PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/447604)).

This is mostly based off of https://git.pyrox.dev/pyrox/nix/src/branch/main/packages/glide-browser-bin/package.nix, and adapted to support multiple architectures.
